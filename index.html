			<h3>- History with computers -</h3>
			<p>My history with computers is very interesting.
				<br>
				It started when I was 4 years old, when I got my first Amazon Fire tablet...
				<br>
				I was an experimental child, so what I did was I downloaded an app called 'ES File Explorer' to see what was on the device.
				<br>
				I ended up finding a HACK on the device, where I could create UNLIMITED user accounts with endless ages by opening the settings app from the explorer. (I WAS STILL 4 HERE)
				<br>
				I ended up watching YouTube all night, and then my parents found out D:
				<br>
				They put a time limit on the device, but they hadn't found my 'life hack' yet.
				<br>
				They found out about a year later later xD
				<br>
				It probably still works today.
				<br>
				Try it on a time limited child account.
				<br>
				You'll be surprised if it works, <p class="bold"> I WAS 4 YEARS OLD!!!</p>
