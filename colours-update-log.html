        <h1>Colours Update Log</h1>
        <a href="#game" class="link">Skip to playable embed</a>
        <p>Updated soon after the release of the actual version!<br>
            Colours can be found <a class="link" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/409585063/">here.</a><br>
            -----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
            Beta v1.0<br>
            Update log!<br>
            Walking through the back of walls is no longer possible.<br>
            Holes removed in mobile edition.<br>
            -----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
            Beta v1.1<br>
            Trail added yay!<br>
            Black lines removed!!<br>
            The starting area no longer says BETA :)<br>
            Play button removed (It was soooo ugly)<br>
            Mobile version renamed<br>
            -----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
            Beta v1.2<br>
            Music added (I quickly threw it together in Chrome Music Lab). It sounds stupid but I like it. Link is <a class="link" href="https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker/song/6356732473769984.">here.</a><br>
            Mobile text repositioned<br>
            Added intro and automatic playing instead of a simple animation<br>
            -----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
            Beta v1.2.1<br>
            Slight refinements added to game<br>
            Level teleporter now has a gradient and turns green on level 5.<br>
            Cover redesigned + secret cover designed for returning players who have completed the game (will use cloud variables)<br>
            Sadly, the mobile version is very unstable and will be down for a while while the problems are fixed while both versions are back into the beta phase.<br>
            -----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
            Beta v1.2.2<br>
            Enhanced code so sprites will not be shown until needed and broadcast scripts for 'Cover' and 'Game' run before sprites apply ghost effect.<br>
            Differently shaped level teleporter!<br>
            -----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
            v1.0<br>
            Game came out of Beta into v1.0!<br>
            WASD controls added (only W, A and D are needed though)<br>
            Spikes have been added, respawning the player when touched.<br>
            Jumping has been added finally!!<br>
            Issues with the intro and cover have been fixed, with a cool new animation for the cover.<br>
            Text is now a cool outline!!<br>
            The sun rotates and goes down with levels.<br>
            The sky gradually gets darker as the game progresses.<br>
            Some levels redesigned.<br>
            Coloured gets a crown when the game has been completed.<br>
            Music changed to a cooler one that I like more. New link is <a class="link" href="https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker/song/4773155078406144">here!</a><br>
            Cover gets changed to inverted version (previously useless) when the game is completed.<br>
            The ground is slightly thicker on the cover.<br>
            Due to bugs and having to use my backpack a lot, the mobile version has been discontinued but maybe not forever. I am SO sorry mobile players!<br>
            -----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
            v1.0.1<br>
            Added prompts to heart and favourite at the end. YOU MUST. [in robot voice]<br>

            Coloured has a gradient now!<br>
            BRAND NEW PAINT.NET LOGO WOO!!!<br>
            Broken costumes (with clear broken outlines) fixed with a transparent box.<br>
            Sky backdrops have been altered to make more sense.<br>
            Spikes and lava are no longer blinding saturation! They are now a softer red.<br>
            Version numbering has changed, now instead of 1.1.0.1 it will be 1.1_01 (like old Minecraft lol)<br>
            Bug fixes are in the works (1.1_01)<br>
            That's all YAYAYAYYA!!!!<br>
            -----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
            Sorry for this, but Colours: The Darkness is cancelled for temporary purposes and the fact that my YouTube channel has crashed.<br>
            -----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
            v1.1_01<br>
            New cover costumes - error screen and click to begin.<br>
            You must click the flag and then click before playing - if you click on the stopped screen, it will show the error, as you have to watch my beautiful intro first.<br>
            -----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
            1.1_011<br>
            Hearts at the end killing Coloured issue fixed.<br>

            v1.2<br>
            Mobile controls added as a toggle! Finally there can be only one project! Party everyone!<br>
            The trail has been optimised for lower end systems (like Chromebooks and old PCs) so now it's smooth as butter on even the most RAM eating browsers!<br>
            -----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
            v1.2_01<br>
            Cover updated.<br>

            -----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
