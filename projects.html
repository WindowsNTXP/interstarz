                <h1>PROJECTS</h1>
                <p>Throughout the times, I have created a couple of projects. However, barely ANY have actually released because my motivation level is as stable as a seismograph in use. Too technical? Shit.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Some of my most recent GitHub projects include:</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://github.com/stx3plus1/strlx">strlx</a> - a simple program for displaying system information
                <br>
                <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://github.com/stx3plus1/CustomWelcome95">CustomWelcome95</a> - an abomination of a program that greets you with whatever you want
                <br>
                <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://github.com/stx3plus1/sticks">sticks</a> - this very site you are on right now. the source code is pretty cool yk
                <br>
                <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://github.com/stx3plus1/ircdk">ircdk</a> - a basic IRC client in C that's pretty insane
                <br>
                and still lots to come.. SOON...
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In previous times, I attempted numerous development systems, said screw it, and eventually wound up making my own kernel. That's how stupid my projects have gone in past. I don't know how long I will have the willing to do this sort of thing where I'm in an infinite loop of programming with other stuff mixed in, but it better not stop soon, as I have some actually cool and useful projects peeking the horizon.</p>
